# Work with Deep Learning Libraries

This is my work on exploring and working with Deep Learning libraries. For now,
the work is on PyTorch.

## Why this?

Well, there have been times where I've had ideas but didn't know how to implement things from scatch. I do a lot of code reading, but learning something extensively from a book is always better, I believe. This is for me, and for those who are interested in learning PyTorch. I'm looking forward to complete the book (link below)!

## Daily Goals -

1. Started from December 16th 2018. Learnt Basics, Tensors. Completed till Chapter 2
2. Updates - Now on Chapter 3, (December 20 '18). Goal to complete Chapter 4, (by December 21 '18).
